# ORDER IN INCREMENTS TO AVOID BEING LOCKED!
 
We recommend these increments as a guideline:
$50 -> $100 -> $125 -> $150 -> $200... etc
To be safe you might want to stay at one increment for a few orders and slowly build your way up. 
 
Some increments may fail, so just be patient and don't be greedy!

# Notes:
- PATIENCE IS KEY!
- Your Amazon account will need to be at least 6 months old with at least 3 recent orders.
- Browse around on the site for a couple minutes before/after linking the card and before ordering your items.
- Once your card is linked, wait at least 1 day before placing any orders.
- Wait until all pending orders have delivered and wait 1-2 days before ordering the next increment.
- Keep item count as low as possible per order; 1 item will have a higher success rate than 3 items.
- If you get a decline/revision. The card is dead, unlink before it locks your amazon account.
- Only order physical items.
